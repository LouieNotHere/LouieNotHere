Here's the reason why:
Relationships can provide a source of happiness... It's not like i'm rushing things up actually. I just need someone special. someone who can make me happy. someone who can support me. someone who can help me. especially, someone who truly loves me til eternity.

What made me do this? My father demands one from me. It's not a high demand though xd.
